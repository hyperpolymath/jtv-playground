== Overview

This repository is a **controlled playground** for JTV (Julia-the-Viper) language development. Per the ANCHOR scope policy, all activities are scoped exclusively to JTV language, tooling, and UX experiments.

=== What is JTV?

Julia-the-Viper is a systems programming language designed for Harvard architecture embedded systems where code and data live in separate memory spaces.

Key features:

* **Harvard Architecture Native**: Separate code/data address spaces
* **Flash-Optimized**: Efficient code storage in flash memory
* **RAM Conservation**: Minimize RAM usage for data
* **Embedded Focus**: AVR, PIC, ARM Cortex-M
* **Zero Runtime**: No hidden allocations

== Quick Start

All operations are routed through `just`:

[source,bash]
----
just --list    # Show available commands
just test      # Run test corpus (offline)
just demo      # Run JTV demonstration (offline)
----

== Scope Policy

Per `.machine_read/ANCHOR.scope-arrest.2026-01-01.scm`:

=== Allowed

* JTV language experiments
* Parser/AST/type experiments supporting JTV
* REPL / playground UI
* Conformance harnesses and corpora
* Benchmark harnesses relevant to JTV

=== Legacy (Frozen)

* All non-JTV experiments are in `experiments/_attic/`
* No new features or expansion permitted

=== Forbidden

* General polyglot experiments
* New frameworks not required for JTV
* Network-required execution paths for demos/tests

== Golden Path

The f0 milestone success criteria:

[source,bash]
----
just --list   # Shows available recipes
just test     # Runs offline, validates >=5 samples (3 valid, 2 invalid)
just demo     # Runs offline, demonstrates JTV feature
----

== Language Policy

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Category | Languages | Notes

| Primary
| Julia, ReScript, Scheme, Shell, Just, Nickel
| For all new code

| Allowed
| Rust
| For tooling/WASM only

| Quarantined
| Python, Node/npm
| Legacy only, no expansion

| Forbidden
| TypeScript (source), Makefiles
| Use alternatives
|===

== Command Routing

All operations must go through:

* `just <recipe>` - User-visible operations
* `must` - Deployment/physical-state transitions (Mustfile)

Do not run ad-hoc commands. If a recipe doesn't exist, add it to the justfile first.

== Contributing

This is a controlled workbench. Before contributing:

1. Read `.machine_read/ANCHOR.scope-arrest.2026-01-01.scm`
2. Ensure your contribution relates to JTV language/tooling
3. All new code goes in `jtv/` directory
4. Route all operations through `just` recipes
