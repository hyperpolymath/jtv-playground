/* EXPERIMENTS */

This repository contains experimental implementations across domains:

Backend:
- Deno + ReScript (type-safe JavaScript alternative)
- Julia (high-performance scientific computing)
- ArangoDB (multi-model graph database)

Frontend:
- Svelte (reactive UI framework)
- Vue 3 (progressive framework)
- Solid.js (fine-grained reactivity)

Infrastructure:
- Podman (rootless containers, Docker alternative)
- Nix (reproducible builds)
- justfile (build automation)

Patterns:
- CRDTs (offline-first distributed state)
- Design Patterns (GoF in multiple languages)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)

/* ATTRIBUTION */
